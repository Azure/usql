# Sample input file for FixEncodingErrors script
This is a sample text file to demonstrate the use of FixEncodingErrors U-SQL script.
This file is UTF-8 encoded.

Here is Cat Emoji (U+1F408) embedded in the text: '🐈'.
The UTF-8 byte sequence for this Unicode code point is F0 9F 90 88 (in HEX).

Here is the same code point encoded in a wrong way ''.
Byte sequence is ED A0 BD ED B0 88 (high and low surrogate halves are encoded independently).

Note that in the output file (EncodingErrorSample.filtered.txt), the script
substitutes bad bytes with the replacement character '�' (U+FFFD).
However, in the errors file (EncodingErrorSample.errors.txt),
the bad bytes are written without changes.
