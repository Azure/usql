# Sample input file for FixEncodingErrors script
This is a sample text file to demonstrate the use of FixEncodingErrors U-SQL script.
This file is UTF-8 encoded.

Here is Cat Emoji (U+1F408) embedded in the text: '🐈'.
The UTF-8 byte sequence for this Unicode code point is F0 9F 90 88 (in HEX).

Here is the same code point encoded in a wrong way ''.
Byte sequence is ED A0 BD ED B0 88.
This encoding error happens if high and low UTF-16 surrogate halves are
encoded individually instead of, as required by UTF-8 specification,
encoding the Unicode code point directly into UTF-8.

Note that in the output file (EncodingErrorSample.filtered.txt), the script
substitutes bad bytes with the replacement character '�' (U+FFFD).
However, in the errors file (EncodingErrorSample.errors.txt),
the bad bytes are written without changes.
